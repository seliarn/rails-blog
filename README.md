# Simple Blog by Popov Serhii

This is my first posted Ruby on Rails project. There is I've showed how I would be developing simple blog.
I've used only basic RoR features.

For deploy this project you should follow these steps:
1. Install Ruby (prefer 3.2.2 version)
2. Install PostgreSQL
3. npm install
3. Run migrations 

    `db:migrate`
4. Start the Rails server

     `bin/rails server`
5. Open in your browser http://127.0.0.1:3000/
